# Common Patterns in TL-Verilog Conversion

Hi! I'm [Your Name], and I've been working on converting various Verilog modules to TL-Verilog. Let me share some common patterns I've encountered and how to handle them.

## Reset Handling

One of the most common patterns I've seen is converting asynchronous resets to synchronous ones. Here's what I learned:

```verilog
// Original Verilog with async reset
always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
   if (!rst_n)
      q <= 1'b0;
   else
      q <= d;
end

// TL-Verilog version with sync reset
logic rst;
assign rst = ~rst_n;

always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
   if (rst)
      q <= 1'b0;
   else
      q <= d;
end
```

Key points:
- Convert active-low to active-high
- Remove from sensitivity list
- Keep the same reset value

## Clock Domain Handling

Another common pattern is clock domain analysis. Here's what I look for:

1. Single clock domains
2. Clock gating
3. Clock division

Example:
```verilog
// Original Verilog with clock gating
always @(posedge clk) begin
   if (clk_en)
      q <= d;
end

// TL-Verilog version
always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
   if (rst)
      q <= 1'b0;
   else if (clk_en)
      q <= d;
end
```

## State Machine Patterns

State machines are everywhere! Here's what I've learned:

1. Use clear state encoding
2. Keep state transitions explicit
3. Document state meanings

Example:
```verilog
// Original Verilog state machine
localparam IDLE = 2'b00;
localparam BUSY = 2'b01;
localparam DONE = 2'b10;

always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
   if (!rst_n)
      state <= IDLE;
   else
      case (state)
         IDLE: if (start) state <= BUSY;
         BUSY: if (done) state <= DONE;
         DONE: state <= IDLE;
      endcase
end

// TL-Verilog version
logic rst;
assign rst = ~rst_n;

always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
   if (rst)
      state <= IDLE;
   else
      case (state)
         IDLE: if (start) state <= BUSY;
         BUSY: if (done) state <= DONE;
         DONE: state <= IDLE;
      endcase
end
```

## Control Signal Patterns

Control signals often need special attention:

1. Clear priority ordering
2. No conflicting conditions
3. Default behavior handling

Example:
```verilog
// Original Verilog with control signals
always @(posedge clk) begin
   if (load)
      q <= data_in;
   else if (shift)
      q <= {serial_in, q[7:1]};
end

// TL-Verilog version
always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
   if (rst)
      q <= 8'b0;
   else if (load)
      q <= data_in;
   else if (shift)
      q <= {serial_in, q[7:1]};
end
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Forgetting Reset Conversion**
   - Always convert async to sync
   - Keep reset values consistent

2. **Missing Control Signal Priority**
   - Document priority clearly
   - Handle all conditions

3. **Incomplete Clock Analysis**
   - Check for clock gating
   - Look for clock division
   - Verify single clock domain

4. **State Machine Issues**
   - Use clear state encoding
   - Handle all state transitions
   - Include default behavior

## Tips for Success

1. Start with a clear understanding of the original design
2. Document your conversion decisions
3. Test each change thoroughly
4. Keep the original code for reference
5. Use formal verification when possible

Remember: These patterns are guidelines, not rules. Each design might need special consideration. The key is to understand the intent of the original design and preserve it in the TL-Verilog version.
