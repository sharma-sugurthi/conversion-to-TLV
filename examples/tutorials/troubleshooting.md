# Troubleshooting TL-Verilog Conversions

Hi! I'm [Your Name], and I've encountered my fair share of challenges while converting Verilog to TL-Verilog. Let me share some common issues and how to resolve them.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Formal Verification Failures

**Problem**: Your conversion passes simulation but fails formal verification.

**Solution**:
1. Check reset handling
   ```verilog
   // Wrong: Missing reset in some conditions
   always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
      if (load)
         q <= data_in;
      else if (shift)
         q <= {serial_in, q[7:1]};
   end

   // Correct: Include reset in all paths
   always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
      if (rst)
         q <= 8'b0;
      else if (load)
         q <= data_in;
      else if (shift)
         q <= {serial_in, q[7:1]};
   end
   ```

2. Verify state machine completeness
   ```verilog
   // Wrong: Missing default case
   case (state)
      IDLE: if (start) state <= BUSY;
      BUSY: if (done) state <= DONE;
   endcase

   // Correct: Include default case
   case (state)
      IDLE: if (start) state <= BUSY;
      BUSY: if (done) state <= DONE;
      default: state <= IDLE;
   endcase
   ```

### 2. Timing Issues

**Problem**: Your design works in simulation but has timing violations.

**Solution**:
1. Check clock domain crossings
2. Verify reset timing
3. Look for combinational loops

Example:
```verilog
// Problem: Potential timing issue
always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
   if (rst)
      q <= 1'b0;
   else
      q <= q + 1;  // Using output in next state
end

// Solution: Use intermediate register
logic [3:0] next_q;
always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
   if (rst)
      q <= 1'b0;
   else
      q <= next_q;
end

always_comb begin
   next_q = q + 1;
end
```

### 3. Control Signal Conflicts

**Problem**: Multiple control signals causing unexpected behavior.

**Solution**:
1. Establish clear priority
2. Handle all combinations
3. Add default behavior

Example:
```verilog
// Problem: Unclear priority
always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
   if (load && shift)  // What happens here?
      q <= data_in;
   else if (load)
      q <= data_in;
   else if (shift)
      q <= {serial_in, q[7:1]};
end

// Solution: Clear priority
always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
   if (rst)
      q <= 8'b0;
   else if (load)  // Load takes priority
      q <= data_in;
   else if (shift)
      q <= {serial_in, q[7:1]};
end
```

### 4. State Machine Issues

**Problem**: State machine getting stuck or missing transitions.

**Solution**:
1. Add state transition monitoring
2. Include timeout mechanisms
3. Verify all paths

Example:
```verilog
// Problem: Potential deadlock
case (state)
   IDLE: if (start) state <= BUSY;
   BUSY: if (done) state <= DONE;
   DONE: if (ack) state <= IDLE;
endcase

// Solution: Add timeout and monitoring
logic [7:0] timeout_counter;
always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
   if (rst) begin
      state <= IDLE;
      timeout_counter <= 8'b0;
   end
   else begin
      case (state)
         IDLE: if (start) state <= BUSY;
         BUSY: begin
            if (done) state <= DONE;
            else if (timeout_counter == 8'hFF) state <= IDLE;
            else timeout_counter <= timeout_counter + 1;
         end
         DONE: if (ack) state <= IDLE;
      endcase
   end
end
```

## Debugging Tips

1. **Use Waveform Viewer**
   - Look for unexpected transitions
   - Check timing relationships
   - Verify control signals

2. **Add Debug Signals**
   ```verilog
   // Add state transition monitoring
   logic state_changed;
   always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
      if (rst)
         state_changed <= 1'b0;
      else
         state_changed <= (state != next_state);
   end
   ```

3. **Check Reset Behavior**
   - Verify all registers reset properly
   - Check reset timing
   - Look for reset conflicts

4. **Monitor Control Signals**
   - Log signal changes
   - Check for glitches
   - Verify timing relationships

## Best Practices

1. **Document Everything**
   - Keep a log of changes
   - Note verification results
   - Document assumptions

2. **Test Incrementally**
   - Make small changes
   - Verify after each change
   - Keep working versions

3. **Use Formal Tools**
   - Run property checks
   - Verify state coverage
   - Check for deadlocks

4. **Maintain Clean Code**
   - Use clear naming
   - Add helpful comments
   - Follow consistent style

Remember: Debugging is an iterative process. Start with the most likely issues and work your way through systematically. Don't hesitate to ask for help when stuck!
